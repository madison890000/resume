# Resume

## Description

This is a personal project which is trying to show someone`s resume more readable and professional.

It is actually redundant and encompassing a lot of repetitive information in own resume created by Word or exported from
LinkedIn.

So I try to Highlight the information that we feel is important and weaken the information that is necessary but is like
a running list.
